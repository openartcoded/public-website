## Introduction

Passionate about computers since I was six years old, I have developed strong experience in full-stack development over the years.

I feel comfortable in Java, which I have been working with daily since 2013, in JavaScript/TypeScript, and in Rust, which I have learned and practiced in my free time since 2020.

On the DevOps side, I have developed significant expertise in Docker, Git, Kubernetes, GitHub / Woodpecker CI pipelines, and Ansible, which I use to automate the deployment of my own servers.

On the framework side, I am proficient in Spring and Spring Boot, Apache Camel, and the most common tools in the Java ecosystem (Maven, Hibernate, JUnit, ...).

I have also developed and maintained many Angular and Ember.js applications in a professional setting.

For personal projects, I now choose to work with React, as it sometimes offers a larger set of libraries.

Whether it's a professional or a personal project, I focus on user experience, performance, and best practices that help keep the code structured and maintainable.

In general, I always try to stay up to date by regularly watching conferences, testing new ideas, and working with different technologies.

In the past, I have had the chance to mentor junior developers, which I particularly enjoyed.

Curious by nature, I am interested in everything related to computing, especially in understanding how things work in depth. Even if itâ€™s not a matter of writing assembly code for a business application, I take advantage of my free time, when possible, to explore older architectures (8 bit), as they are simpler to understand and therefore more accessible.

Aside from computing, I enjoy sports (Ligue 1!), video games, logic puzzles, classic board games (go, chess), cinema, and hiking.
