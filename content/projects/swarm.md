[Swarm](https://swarm.bittich.be) is an open-source project designed to extract data published by administrative units in Flanders and republish it as linked data.

It takes advantage of the Flemish government's [open data initiative](https://www.vlaanderen.be/agentschap-binnenlands-bestuur/blikvangers/lokale-besluiten-als-gelinkte-open-data), which motivates local administrations to publish their decisions as linked open data since 2019.

Largely inspired by a similar existing project, it's **not intended** to replace any existing tools; I use it primarily as a sandbox for trying out new ideas in data extraction and processing. For production-level work, I'd strongly recommend using a more reliable solution.

### How It Works

Administrative units publish their decisions and meeting notes as [RDFa](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) annotated html. Swarm scrapes this data, processes it, and republishes it in a usable format.

Swarm works with configurable & schedulable jobs (called job definitions), each made up of a series of tasks, and each task is a microservice with a specific responsibility, communicating through events via a [NATS](https://nats.io/) message broker.

The primary data processing pipeline consists of the following steps:

`collect` Scrapes html pages

`extract` Parses RDFa annotations and converts them into N-Triples

`filter` Applies shacl shapes to validate and filter the data

`add-uuid` Enrich RDF subjects with an uuid

`diff` Compares extracted data with the previous successful job to calculate the delta

`publish` Insert new triples and remove outdated ones in the triplestore

`index` Convert and upsert meilisearch documents based on a config

`archive` Flag the previous job as archived and ready for deletion

Jobs can be scheduled using cron expressions, and the entire system is adaptable to other domains beyond administrative units data.

Swarm also has a dedicated microservice called `sync-consumer`, that lets third parties consume the extracted data without having to run their own Swarm instance; when a job finishes successfully, the system generates an archive containing the new triples to insert, the triples to delete, and the intersection with the previous job (for initial sync), making it straightforward to keep external triplestores in sync.

This feature was not well tested, so if you'd like to try it, please [contact me](/about).

Swarm is developed in Rust, but other languages can be used. For example, the filter step is written in Java.

Swarm uses Virtuoso as its triplestore and Meilisearch for indexing, because it's fast and offers a great developer experience. Job and task metadata are stored in MongoDB, since that data doesn’t really benefit from being stored as semantic data. This setup keeps the pipeline simpler and faster, but I might revisit this choice if a good reason to use linked data for the metadata comes up in the future.

### Custom Components

Swarm is a handmade project that relies on custom components:

- [an RDFa parser](https://github.com/nbittich/graph-rdfa-processor)
- [a turtle/N-Triple parser](https://github.com/nbittich/tortank)
- [a web crawler/scraper](https://github.com/nbittich/swarm/tree/master/crawler)

These components are not intended for production use due to their experimental nature.

### Get started:

- [Fork the project](https://github.com/nbittich/swarm)
- [Run it locally](https://github.com/nbittich/app-swarm)
- [Deploy it](https://github.com/nbittich/ansible-deployment)

### Next steps

- Use the data to explore [fine-tuning AI models](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)>).
- ~Write a parser for [Microdata](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html)~
  - Create a new job definition to scrape websites annotated with the [microdata](https://github.com/nbittich/microdata) parser

### Request for Removal

If you identify personal or sensitive data sourced from your website and would like it to be removed, please [contact me](/about).
I will review your request and take appropriate action without delay.
